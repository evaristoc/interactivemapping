EDIT SECTIONS
- For the geogroup
- For the items in the geogroup

EDIT == CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE

Ideas for editing section:
- Popups per item:
--- +++: relatively easy to spot and change item info directly on the map
--- ---: can become cluttered if many/too close items
- Modal:
--- +++: dedicated
--- ---: might hide map view; people must know what they are changing
- Sidebar:
--- +++: centralized
--- ---: might hide map view; people must know what they are changing
- Double screen:
--- +++: centralized
--- ---: might get too small for map view
- Two level Edit (one for group, one for items)
